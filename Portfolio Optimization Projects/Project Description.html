           Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing</a></h3>

         <p>The purpose of this project was to apply what I had learnt in R onto portfolio optimization.</p>
         <p>The first part introduces the relevant packages and functions in R, which includes importing
           stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculating returns and important evaluation metrics.</p>
         <p>The second part involves single-period optimization and periodic optimization and
           back-testing. For the single-period optimization, I created one portfolio that minimizes
           variance and another that maximizes returns. For the back-testing optimization, I used the
           mean-variance portfolio, and solved the optimization using the random portfolio method.</p>

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization Projects/Effect of Risk Measures on Portfolio Composition and Performance.html" target="_blank">
           Effects of Risk Measures on Portfolio Composition and Performance</a></h3>

         <p>In this project, I attempted to determine the effects of the different risk measures on portfolio
           optimization and performance. The following risk measures have been used:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Variance and Standard Deviation</li>
           <li>Semi-Variance and Semi-Deviation</li>
           <li>Downside Deviation</li>
           <li>Value-at-Risk</li>
           <li>Conditional Value-at-Risk (or Expected Shortfall, Expected Tail Loss)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In the first part, I introduced the different measures on a single security and show how they
           differ. In the second part, I generated random portfolios and optimized two sets of portfolios:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures</li>
           <li>Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures for a given level of return</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The portfolio was created using 10 large-cap U.S. equities, and benchmarked against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).</p>

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization Projects/Random Selection Expertise and Index Investing.html" target="_blank">
           Random Selection, Expertise and Index Investing</a></h3>
         <p>The aim of this project is to find out if portfolios made of 15 randomly selected stocks from the S&P500
           Large-Cap Index can outperform stock-picking experts and index investing. The portfolios were optimized
           based on the mean-variance framework developed by Harry Markowitz for simplicity, with the goal of maximizing
           the ex-post Sharpe Ratio during the optimization period.</p>
         <p>The project is meant to be a fun/thought experiment, and is not meant to disprove of index or active investing.
           It does not make use of any statistical methods to prove that random selection, expertise or index investing is
           a better choice.</p>
