       <h1>Hi, I'm Zheng Liang</h1>
       <p>
         I'm an Economics undergraduate in my third year at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
         This website contains projects on econometrics and portfolio optimization (with possibly more topics in the future)
         which I learnt during my course of study at NTU. The projects serve as a way to learn about the applications of R in
         these fields using real-world data, such as stock prices and economic data.
       </p>
       <p>
         Using the navigation bar or links below would open a new tab/window to show the content for the respective projects.
       </p>

       <section>
         <h2>Portfolio Optimization Projects</h2>

         <p>The projects in this topic covers portfolio optimization in R and explores different measures of returns and
           risks.</a></p>

         <p>It also includes some fun/thought experiments which I wanted to test/evaluate. However, such projects do not
           delve into the use of statistical methods to prove or disprove of any investment or trading methodology.</a></p>

         <h2>Introductory Guides</h2>
         <p>
           The files here are beginner guides to some of the packages I have been using for the different projects on this site.
         </a></p>

         <p>
           I produced it while exploring the different functions and attempted to clarify some of the confusion I had while
           using them in my projects. It does not cover all the functions in each package, only those that I used frequently, thus
           making the guides somewhat complete. However, I hope that compiling the problems I faced and Googled while using the packages
           into a document would be able to help others who encounter the same problems.
