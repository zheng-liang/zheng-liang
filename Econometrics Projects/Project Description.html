           Forecasting Singapore CPI Using Different Time Series Models</a></h3>

         <p>Through this project, I attempted to apply what I had learnt about time series models and forecasting during my undergraduate
           course using R.</p>

         <p>The project uses ARIMA, ARDL and VAR models to forecast Singapore's Consumer Price Index using data from previous periods and
           with other variables, namely the Domestic Supply Price Index and the Composite Leading Index of Singapore.</p>

         <p>I wanted to do this project to find out if R was suitable for time series analysis, as compared to Stata or EViews, which I
           had used during my undergraduate coursework. It was not as simple and straightforward as these softwares, and the disadvantages
           have been highlighted in my discussion.</p>
