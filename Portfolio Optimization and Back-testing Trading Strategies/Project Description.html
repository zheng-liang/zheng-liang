       <h1>Project Description</h1>
       <p>
       Gives an overview of each project in Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies.

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing.html" target="_blank">
           Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing</a></h3>

         <p>The purpose of this project was to apply what I had learnt in R onto portfolio optimization.</p>
         <p>The first part introduces the relevant packages and functions in R, which includes importing
           stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculating returns and important evaluation metrics.</p>
         <p>The second part involves single-period optimization and periodic optimization and
           back-testing. For the single-period optimization, I created one portfolio that minimizes
           variance and another that maximizes returns. For the back-testing optimization, I used the
           mean-variance portfolio, and solved the optimization using the random portfolio method.</p>
       </section>

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Effect of Risk Measures on Portfolio Composition and Performance.html" target="_blank">
           Effects of Risk Measures on Portfolio Composition and Performance</a></h3>

         <p>In this project, I attempted to determine the effects of the different risk measures on portfolio
           optimization and performance. The following risk measures have been used:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Variance and Standard Deviation</li>
           <li>Semi-Variance and Semi-Deviation</li>
           <li>Downside Deviation</li>
           <li>Value-at-Risk</li>
           <li>Conditional Value-at-Risk (or Expected Shortfall, Expected Tail Loss)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In the first part, I introduced the different measures on a single security and show how they
           differ. In the second part, I generated random portfolios and optimized two sets of portfolios:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures</li>
           <li>Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures for a given level of return</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The portfolio was created using 10 large-cap U.S. equities, and benchmarked against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).</p>

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Random Selection Expertise and Index Investing.html" target="_blank">
           Random Selection, Expertise and Index Investing</a></h3>

         <p>The aim of this project is to find out if portfolios made of 15 randomly selected stocks from the S&P500
           Large-Cap Index can outperform stock-picking experts and index investing. The portfolios were optimized
           based on the mean-variance framework developed by Harry Markowitz for simplicity, with the goal of maximizing
           the ex-post Sharpe Ratio during the optimization period.</p>
         <p>The project is meant to be a fun/thought experiment, and is not meant to disprove of index or active investing.
           It does not make use of any statistical methods to prove that random selection, expertise or index investing is
           a better choice.</p>
       </section>

       <section>
         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Returns and Risks_The Mean and The Median.html" target="_blank">
           Returns and Risks: The Mean and The Median</a></h3>

         <p>The purpose of this project is to find out if using median returns in portfolio optimization could lead to better
           portfolio performance compared to mean returns. Due to the non-normal distribution of returns, the median may be a
           better optimization objective of expected returns than the mean.</p>
         <p>I found that portfolios maximizing the median returns led to better diversification than maximizing the mean returns.
           Furthermore, minimizing the median absolute deviation resulted in a portfolio that has the highest return among portfolios
           minimizing the different risk measures. However, this project does not include an optimal portfolio selection which maximizes
           return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of return. The project does include a few other flaws,
           such as having only a small number of random portfolios generated for testing and not being able to show conclusively that the
           median measure is better than the mean.</p>

         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Testing a Trading Strategy Using a Rolling Window CAPM.html" target="_blank">
           Testing a Trading Strategy Using a Rolling Window CAPM</a></h3>

         <p>This project aims to test if the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) estimated using a rolling window could allow an investor
           or trader to take advantage of inefficiencies in market pricing. I used a short-term modeling strategy with 5 trading days of
           historical data per estimation to capture the short-term pricing inefficiencies. It does not conclude if the strategy is effective
           for all stocks, but applying the CAPM trading strategy on Apple Inc. was able to yield short-term outperformance. Furthermore, the
           stock had outperformed the S&P 500 ETF over the years but it could be attributed to having chosen a stock that had outperformed the
           market consistently.</p>
       </section>

       <section>
         <h3><a href="/Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing Trading Strategies/Backtesting a 5-day and 20-day Moving Average Trading Strategy.html" target="_blank">
           Backtesting a 5-day and 20-day Moving Average Trading Strategy</a></h3>

         <p>Through this project, I tested the feasibility of using 5-day and 20-day Moving Averages to generate trading signals. I used the
           Simple Moving Average and Exponential Moving Average on the daily timeframe to generate signals for short-term trading and tested its
           effectiveness.</p>

         <p>The results show that SMA and EMA can provide excess returns for some stocks and may lead to poor returns when used on other stocks.
           However, these results were based on the assumptions of zero trading costs and that trades could be filled at the opening prices at
           any point in time. By including trading costs, one would obtain significantly lower returns depending on how frequent buy and sell
           signals were generated. Furthermore, past performance is not indicative of future performance and thus, if the results show that the
           moving average strategy worked for a stock based on the backtest, it may not work in the future.</p>
