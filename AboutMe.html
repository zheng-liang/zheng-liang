       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
       Hello! This GitHub Pages is my first shot at using GitHub.
       </p>

       <p>
       I am Tan Zheng Liang, a 3rd Year Economics undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University
       Singapore. This GitHub Pages serves as a record of my learning experience in R and the codes are
       made available in the projects and my <a href="https://github.com/zheng-liang/Learning-R">Learning-R Repository</a>.
       I mainly learned R for portfolio optimization and econometric modelling.
       </p>

       <p>
       Everyone is welcomed to read about the projects that are on the site. However, as I am still learning
       about the topics of portfolio optimization and econometric modelling, the content may not be suitable
       for readers who are looking for advanced materials on these topics.
       </p>
